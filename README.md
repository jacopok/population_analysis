# Population Analysis

Analysis of the outputs of the MOBSE (and maybe FASTCLUSTER) code.

How to use:
clone this repo, with 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacopok/population_analysis
```
then, move into the folder (`cd population_analysis`) and run 
```
pip install .
```

This will install the module `population_analysis` in the current folder. 

Then, you can make your own folder and place inside it some scripts, 
which can import functions from `population_analysis`. 
For an example, see the folder `jacopo/`.
